# Alzheimer-Disease

Description: Developed a system for the early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease using MRI scans. The project involved balancing the dataset using SMOTE to address class imbalance. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed for both feature extraction and classification, ensuring high accuracy in predicting the disease across different stages.

Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, SMOTE, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Learning, MRI Scans, Data Augmentation.
We have tested on different parameters like dense unit , dropout rate and optimizers . We got the highest accuracy using dense unit - 1024 neurons ,dropout rate- 0.3 and adam optimizer.
Highest accuracy is 99.37%.
The dataset used in this research, which categorizes Alzheimer's disease into four classes based on neuroimaging, can be accessed at Kaggle: Alzheimer's Dataset (4 Class of Images).
Two sets of the 6400-photo dataset—the training and testing sets—each include roughly 5100 (80%) and 1275 (20%) photos that have been classified based on the degree of AD. The database is further categorized into four types. mild-demented, nom-demented, very-mild-demented, and moderate-demented.
