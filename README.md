# Alzheimer-Disease
Project Title: Alzheimer's Disease Detection and Classification

Description: Developed a system for the early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease using MRI scans. The project involved balancing the dataset using SMOTE to address class imbalance. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed for both feature extraction and classification, ensuring high accuracy in predicting the disease across different stages.

Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, SMOTE, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Learning, MRI Scans, Data Augmentation.
